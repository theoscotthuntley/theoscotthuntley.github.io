            <p>Deep in a cave, there lived a red cape. Deep in the wall, where nobody could find it.</p>
            <p>But one day came an old man. An old man whom would always be old.</p>
            <p>One day he was walking, trotting to that cave. He found the cape. Put it on. But soon he grew nauseous, exhausted, and ill. He fell unconscious on the floor. Many, many hours later he woke up. Only to find he was young!</p>
            <p>He was happy and playful for the next few days. But soon, on one dark, scary night, he felt a tingling. It grew worse and worse. Then his back started changing, he grew and grew. Soon he was a gigantic beast. He stomped to the city. Killing everyone he saw. Then the cape soaked up the blood. Suddenly he fell to the ground. The cape disappeared, and he became old again.</p>
            <p>The next day he found a mask. He decided to wear itâ€¦ Suddenly, he started burning. His ashes soon turned red. And all that was left was The Red Cape.</p>
