        <p>One day there was a girl she had just been at the mall, when her mother was shot. She was the only witness. But there was something wrong. She looked in the mirror and saw a gray girl with such a SMILE.</p>
        <p>She had been weirded out by this fact but then she went to her father. He had been crying ever since he figured out his wife had died. But when she went to see him he wasn’t crying. In fact, he seemed to be laughing harder and harder. Then she looked at him. He had such a SMILE…</p>
        <p>She immediately ran away from him and ran down the street to his grandma’s house to see her. But she only looked back with the same SMILE…</p>
        <p>So she ran back to her house and went to the phone. She immediately called the police. They answered like this “be there in a minute hehehe…</p>
        <p>The police finally arrived but with their heads jerking with the same SMILE.</p>
        <p>She looked at herself one last time, looked at the SMILE one last time in the mirror. Then she SMILED herself.</p>
        <p><strong>The End</strong></p>
