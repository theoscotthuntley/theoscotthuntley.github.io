        <h1>The Blood Carve</h1>

        <p>Once upon a time, there lived a little boy named Alex Newton. It was the day before Halloween. He was going to carve pumpkins, or, in other words, carve away his life…</p>
        <p>They finally arrived at a dark night where everyone was nowhere to be seen. First, they tried the corn maze, or, in other words, the Death Maze. They went into the normal-looking maze, but suddenly, Alex felt the ground start to shake. His hands felt uncontrollable. He felt his body sinking into the ground as he started to see hands coming up from the floor. He began feeling nausea growing stronger, and then, it stopped. He was out of the Death Maze, and his parents were beside him. He told them everything. But they just laughed and laughed and said to him, "You think we’re going to believe that?!?" and kept on laughing. So he decided to give up and go to the next thing, a ride on a tractor.</p>
        <p>Next thing he knew, he was already riding on the tractor. But soon enough, he saw the sky get darker, he heard something that sounded like a strange scream, and his parents were gone. He felt hot and nauseous again. But then again, it all disappeared, and he was back with his parents. He was too scared to do anything else at the pumpkin patch, so he went home to The Blood Carve…</p>
        <p>He started to carve the face when suddenly, he couldn’t control his own hands. Right after, he saw blood oozing out from his pumpkin. He felt blood coming out from his veins… The sky was red, and he kept staring at the blood moon that night. The blood getting worse and worse. He couldn’t even feel breathing anymore. Soon he realized he wasn’t. Suddenly, it seemed like it couldn’t get any worse. Then he woke up.</p>
        <p>"Wha- What?" He said dazed and confused in his bed. "I- I guess it was all a dream." Then he saw the pumpkin right next to him. The pumpkin was red…</p>
